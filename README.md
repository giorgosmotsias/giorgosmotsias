# Hi there! 👋 I'm Giorgos Motsias

I'm a Full Stack Developer with a strong passion for building innovative web applications and solving complex problems. I have expertise in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB. Contributed to the development of AutoDL, an AI web app, handling frontend (UI/UX), backend, database management, and designing RESTful APIs.
I am currently leading development of a decentralized finance (DeFi) web application. I am managing both frontend and backend development, with an emphasis on creating a scalable and secure solution on a blockchain-based platform.  

At the same time, I am interested in exploring new libraries and frameworks, continuously enhancing my knowledge and skills.

In my free time, I enjoy dancing Cretan traditional dances, playing tennis, and going to the gym.
